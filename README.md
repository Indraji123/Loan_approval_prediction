# Loan Approval Prediction  

This project predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on various applicant details such as income, loan amount, number of dependents, credit history, etc.  

## Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.  
2. **Model Training**: Using a **Random Forest Classifier** to train the model.  
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.  
4. **Feature Importance**: Visualizing important features that influence loan approval.  

## Dependencies  
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

## Usage  
Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
